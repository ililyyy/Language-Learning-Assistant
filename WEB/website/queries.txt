	part_of_speech VARCHAR(120), 
	difficulty VARCHAR(120), 
	user_id INTEGER,

#Query to get the next ten entries
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) LIMIT 10; "
#same for a specific User with user_id XXX:
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) WHERE user_id=XXX LIMIT 10; "


#Query to get the 10 words with the highest diffficulty
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) ORDER BY difficulty DESC LIMIT 10; "
#same for a specific User with user_id XXX:
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) WHERE user_id=XXX ORDER BY difficulty DESC LIMIT 10; "


#Query to get the 10 words with the lowest diffficulty:
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) ORDER BY difficulty ASC LIMIT 10; "
#same for a specific User with user_id XXX:
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) WHERE user_id=XXX ORDER BY difficulty ASC LIMIT 10; "


#Query to get all the entries that are a specific part of (part_of_speech='category')
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) WHERE part_of_speech=;'category'"
#same for a specific User with user_id XXX:
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) WHERE part_of_speech=;'category' AND user_id=XXX"


#Query to get all the entries in alphabetical order:
"SELECT * FROM (databasename) ORDER BY translation ASC; "
